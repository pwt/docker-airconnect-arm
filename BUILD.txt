Image Build Instructions
========================

Automated Docker Hub builds have been retired as of June 2021, so builds must be
performed locally and manually pushed.

1. Ensure that Docker Desktop is running, on an x86 host
2. From the root of the repo, invoke:
   docker build . --tag psychlist/docker-airconnect-arm
3. Scan the image for vulnerabilities: docker scan psychlist/docker-airconnect-arm
4. Push to Docker Hub
   docker push psychlist/docker-airconnect-arm
